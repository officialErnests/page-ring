# 🌸 gif

An animated GIF of a flower, made with [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/).

## Develop

To run the Remotion studio:

```sh
bun dev
```

## Export

Render the composition as an **image sequence** using PNG as the format. You can do this from the Remotion studio ☝️

Then, go to an APNG maker like [apng-maker.netlify.app](https://apng-maker.netlify.app/), set the speed to 0.03s (~3.33ms), upload all the images, and download the new animated PNG at the bottom!

Remember to [optimise](https://www.apngoptimizer.com/) the image afterwards, as it can be >250KB initially.
